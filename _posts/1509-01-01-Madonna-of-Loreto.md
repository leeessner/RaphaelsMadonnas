The Duke of Aumale acquired this painting with the collection of Salerno as a copy of a famous lost painting by Raphael painted for the church of Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome. It was only in 1979 that, thanks to the inventory number 133 painted on the lower left on the board, it was identified as the original (below, a witness shows the state of conservation before restoration, which had prevented recognize the hand of the master). The gravity of the Virgin, her attitude evoking Saint Veronica wiping the face of Christ, and the veil, symbol of the shroud, announce the Passion.
